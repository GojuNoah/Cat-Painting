# Cat-Painting
This is practice project 2 of 3 in the third project serious in the freecodecamp Responsive Web Design certification.

In this practice project it focused on some more intermediate CSS. Learning more about positioning, z-index, and the transform property.
Using these skills it guided me to make this cat painting. Enjoy!
